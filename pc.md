## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

Git is an open source Version Control System

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

GitHub is essentially the User Interface for all things Git related.

3. Why do we create a branch?

So that we can build off of and test our code without affecting the main.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

We submit pull requests when we want the author of the original to include our changes to the main.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

The question is a bit vague. You can use git switch ot git checkout depending on what your intentions are with the work in FIRST-NAME LAST-NAME branch.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

git fetch-allows you to download commits to your local repo from a remote repository.

git merge- merging allows for independent lines of code developed on a separate branch and integrate them into a single branch.

git pull-fetches and downloads content from a remote repository and immediately updates the local repository to match the content.

7. What is a merge conflict?

When two or more devs change the same lines of code in their branches on the same Repo.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

You can resolve merge conflicts by using the conflict editor.
